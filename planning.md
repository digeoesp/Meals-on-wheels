What is a README?
A README is a file that describes a project, program or app. It often includes information on technologies used, how to install or use the app, and code examples.

On GitHub, a README in your repo acts like an index.html file. If there is a README in a directory of a repo, the README will display as an HTML page.

Markdown
Markdown is a plain text format for writing structured documents. It uses non-alphabetic characters to indicate simple styling choices. The simple syntax makes it easy to read in its raw format and converts easily to a formatted HTML document.

GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown)
GitHub Flavored Markdown, aka GFM, is a dialect of Markdown. It uses the same syntax as Markdown with some additional features, e.g., direct embedding of HTML.

Basic Syntax
h1 - h6 head tags
# = h1, ## = h2, etc.

**text** = bold
*text* = italic

[link text](absolute or relative url)

![image path](absolute or relative url)
